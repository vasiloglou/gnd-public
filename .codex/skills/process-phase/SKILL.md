name: process-phase
description: Executes one phase of a milestone plan under that milestone's own protocol -- harvest obligations, author the spec and stop for its owner gate, implement and verify, review the diff and refactoring, then record and commit. Use for requests to run, process, execute, specify, review, or close a numbered or multi-part phase, and for deciding whether another review round is warranted. It accepts auto=true for explicitly delegated approval, otherwise stops at owner gates, writes no code before recorded spec approval, and treats findings as unproved until reproduced. Opt-in gates run only on explicit owner request; earlier evidence remains tied to its original bytes. Not for authoring the milestone plan, work owned by a project's own workflow skills, or the milestone-close record.

# Process Phase

**Project hook.** If `references/project.md` exists in this skill's directory,
read it first. The project owns it; it names the project's review instrument,
test and gate commands, standing design rules and any project-specific record
fields, and it governs project-specific matters.

**Component index.** A project that keeps one (the `components` skill is
installed and `docs/components/COMPONENTS.md` exists, or `references/project.md`
names another location) uses it in three steps: the spec records what was
searched and reused (step 1), the index changes with the code (step 3), and its
check against the phase's changed files is a gate in the record (step 6). A
project with no index skips all three; nothing else in this skill depends on it.

## Summary

**What:** one phase of a milestone, executed end to end under the plan's
own section 8 execution protocol. Six numbered steps, an owner gate before any
code, and a record that binds the result to bytes on disk.

**The protocol, in one table.** Each step's detail lives in the reference it
names; this table is the contract.

| # | Step | Produces | Stops? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Harvest** the phase's obligations from every source that assigns one | the obligations table that opens the spec note | no |
| 1 | **Spec** | `notes/phase-N-spec.md` | **STOP** |
| 2 | **Owner gate** — approve or amend; optional review over the spec bytes | owner decisions, recorded in the spec with a mark | **STOP** |
| 3 | **Implement + verify** | code + tests; the plan's section 9 row and the phase's impact-closure gates run | no |
| 4 | **Adversarial review of the diff** | `notes/phase-N-<reviewer>-review.md` + one regression test per finding | no |
| 5 | **Refactoring review** | the record's `Refactoring review` section | no |
| 6 | **Record + commit** | `milestones/<milestone>/NNN-phase-N.md` + a commit in the record contract's grammar | done; a STOP only as step 6 says |

**When to use:**
- The owner says "phase N", "the next phase", or "process this phase"
- A phase's spec needs writing, or a written spec needs executing
- A finished phase needs its review, its refactoring review, or its record

**When NOT to use:**
- Revising the milestone plan itself — that is a separate artifact held to the
  project's plan-review bar (`references/project.md`; default: one independent
  reviewer in a different tool), and this skill consumes the plan, never edits
  it. A phase that finds the plan wrong records a **refuted premise** and an
  open-questions row naming the repair; the plan is repaired at milestone close
  ([process-milestone](../process-milestone/SKILL.md))
- The milestone-close record — it cites every phase record and performs the
  open-questions sweep, which is not a phase's work
- Work that one of the project's own workflow skills owns
  (`references/project.md` names any). A phase record's `skill:` field says so
  explicitly

## Invocation and delegated approval

Invoke as `process-phase PHASE MILESTONE [auto=true|auto=false]`; omission means
`auto=false`. Natural-language authorization to auto approve supplies `auto=true`
for the named scope. This is a skill argument, not a command-line flag.

With `auto=true`, the user's explicit delegation supplies approval at steps 1
and 2. Complete the spec and implementability sweep before recording each
ruling as **delegated approval (auto=true)** with date, authorization, chosen
instrument, exact artifact SHA-256, budget and compatibility decisions. Then
continue without a confirmation pause. Never label these agent decisions a
human reading of the artifact. Apply the same recorded delegation to amendments
and changed corpus answers within the authorized scope; retain the prior answer
and explain the change. The default instrument still follows
`references/review-convergence.md`. Optional spec reviews default to omitted
unless needed to settle a concrete uncertainty or expressly requested.

The STOP rows and owner-gate asks below apply when `auto=false`; with `auto=true`
they are recorded transitions, preserving spec-before-implementation ordering.
Delegation does not waive required reviews, falsifiable cases, reproduction,
compatibility, verification, evidence, convergence or commits. It neither
fabricates passing results nor authorizes unrelated destructive/external work,
broad suites or opt-in gates. A technical refusal remains a refusal; continue
independent authorized work and report any genuine unmet prerequisite.

A milestone-wide auto instruction persists across its phases until revoked.
Required plan and close reviews still run under their own protocol. Record their
delegated owner dispositions separately; this skill remains a phase workflow.

## Step 0 — Harvest the obligations

**A phase's obligations are not in one place, and the plan is deliberate about
that.** A spec that reads only the phase's own bullets in section 4 will ship
missing half of what binds it. Collect all of it, by name, before writing prose.

| Source | What it assigns | How it must appear in the spec |
|---|---|---|
| §4, the phase's own section | the deliverables and the **Criteria** list | each criterion becomes a named test with an expected exit |
| §4, the phase's **Residual** paragraph (when present) | an accepted risk, stated in the reviewers' own terms | copied forward verbatim into the spec and then into the record's boundary |
| §9 verification story, this phase's row | the proof obligation | the row is quoted; the spec says which test discharges each clause |
| §0 design rules | rules earlier phases already paid for, binding every remaining phase | each rule bound to this phase's work **by name**, or argued inapplicable |
| §10 open-questions ledger | rows whose owner column names this phase | each becomes a **decision** the owner rules on at step 2 |
| §5 skill-surface table | skill edits and their **pin sites** | pin sites listed; counts measured at execution time, never derived |
| §6 risk register | the failure classes this phase can re-commit | named in the spec's own coverage argument |
| §7 out of scope | what a reviewer must not ask for | a short "out of scope for this phase" section |
| prior phase records | boundaries, open questions and refuted premises still live | anything this phase inherits or discharges, cited by path |

**This is the step to fan out.** Harvesting is mechanical reading across a large
plan and several records, which is exactly what parallel readers are good at and
exactly where a single pass silently skips a row. See
[`references/agent-delegation.md`](references/agent-delegation.md) for what to
delegate, when the owner's go-ahead for it is asked and the default without
one, what each agent returns, and the rule that governs every finding one
brings back.

**Output:** an obligations table at the head of the spec note. Never a pointer —
"see the plan" is how an obligation goes unmet without anyone noticing.

## Step 1 — The spec note, then STOP

Expand the phase's plan section into a scannable spec at
`notes/phase-N-spec.md`: exact schema fragments, exact function signatures, the
rule list, and the test list with expected exits. Full contract in
[`references/spec-note-contract.md`](references/spec-note-contract.md).
A draft that `start-milestone` already wrote at that path for the first phase
is the starting point: complete it under the contract, step 0's obligations
table included, and do not start a second file.
In a project with a component index, the Design section opens with the reuse
table the contract describes: for every capability the phase builds, the
searches run under the `components` skill's Consult steps and the decision.
A capability with no recorded search is an open item, the same as an
unharvested obligation.
The test list includes a verification-selection ledger under
[`references/verification-selection.md`](references/verification-selection.md):
plan-mandated gates, direct phase tests, impact closure, and an explicit
disposition for broader historical suites. A full repository replay is not an
implicit per-phase gate.

Before offering the spec at the gate, run the **implementability sweep** — for
every requirement, can *some* implementation satisfy it as written? The rule
and its named failure shapes are in
[`references/review-convergence.md`](references/review-convergence.md);
implementability is a gate precondition, not a review discovery.

**Then stop.** No implementation file is created, edited, or sketched before
step 2 clears. This is the protocol's one hard ordering rule.

## Step 2 — The owner gate

The owner approves or amends. Three things are decided here, and the skill asks
rather than assumes:

1. **The approval instrument.** Either the spec prose, or a committed fixture
   corpus authored first with narrated expected outcomes — the corpus-first
   pattern, where the owner approves by reading the fixture stories and the
   spec stands as the design record. Corpus-first costs an authoring session
   before implementation, and a phase adopts it only if it earns that cost —
   **so it is asked, never inherited.** The ask is not neutral, though: for the
   three phase shapes named in
   [`references/review-convergence.md`](references/review-convergence.md) —
   serialized formats, exit-code contracts, validation predicates — that
   reference sets corpus-first as the default answer and puts the burden of
   argument on prose. The rule lives there, not here.
2. **Whether the project's review instrument (`references/project.md`) runs
   over the spec bytes.** The project's plan-review bar
   (`references/project.md`; default: one independent reviewer in a different
   tool) is mandated for plan review and milestone close, not per phase. A
   review here is the owner's call. If one runs, note the standing hazard: a
   repair pass introduces defects of its own, so any repair round re-checks the
   neighbours of every edit, and repaired bytes carry no review opinion until
   re-reviewed. **Repeated rounds over one artifact are bounded, and the bound
   is declared before round two** — fill the convergence ledger each round, and
   when the stop rule of
   [`references/review-convergence.md`](references/review-convergence.md) fires,
   the next instrument is implementation, not another review round. That
   reference is the rule's one home; do not paraphrase its conditions here or
   anywhere. The instrument's invocation, preconditions and credential handling
   are the project's (`references/project.md`); a precondition that fails stops
   the run before any reviewer is launched.
3. **Every ledger row harvested at step 0.** Each gets a ruling, marked in the
   spec with an owner mark and a date, so a later reader can tell a decision
   from a draft.

**Opt-in gates.** Read
[`references/architect-overrides.md`](references/architect-overrides.md) when
an opt-in gate or a repeat of one is proposed. A phase end, milestone close,
changed source, or historical plan clause does not itself authorize or require
a new run. The owner must explicitly request one for a named subject and
scope. Focused verification still follows the phase's impact boundary; earlier
evidence never becomes evidence about changed bytes.

**Then stop again.** Implementation begins on explicit go-ahead.

## Step 3 — Implement + verify

- If corpus-first was chosen: the harness lands **red** first — every case
  failing because the lane does not exist — and each subsequent commit names the
  cases it turns green.
- Keep the owner-approved corpus's meanings stable. Add implementation and
  adversarial regression cases as separately identified successors and bind
  their results in the completion record; changing an approved expected answer
  returns that answer to the owner gate.
- Implement lane by lane, not file by file. A lane is a boundary a test can sit
  on (loader → evaluator → CLI → report), so each lane ends green.
- The section 9 row runs as written. Its clauses are the gate, not a summary of
  the gate.
- Run the verification-selection ledger from the approved spec. Select tests by
  changed inputs and downstream contracts, not by age or runtime, and apply the
  inheritance, invalidation, cadence, and isolation rules in
  [`references/verification-selection.md`](references/verification-selection.md).
- A selected test that already fails on the base tree, before the phase's first
  edit, is a known red. The known-red rule in
  [`references/review-and-record.md`](references/review-and-record.md) (the
  phase extensions) applies here, at step 3; its proof goes in with the
  implementation findings.
- Use the reduced test selection for ordinary phase work: direct phase
  tests and focused affected-consumer tests under the project's default test
  configuration. Preserve the configured exclusions; do not launch an
  exhaustive historical replay merely because its inputs changed. The exact
  selection and explicit-request rule live in the verification-selection
  reference. An invalidated old claim becomes unavailable until its selected
  current-byte controls run; it does not authorize a broad replay.
- **The shipment rule applies without exception: a declared branch that has no
  case which can fail it does not ship.** This is the protocol's defining defect
  class, and a careful spec draft still commits it. Count coverage per
  **branch**, not per class: a finding class whose second half is unreachable
  with the chosen fixtures is half-covered, and closing it may mean editing the
  fixtures themselves rather than adding cases.
- In a project with a component index, the index changes in the same commit as
  the code: follow the `components` skill's Update rules for every module the
  phase adds, moves or retires, and regenerate.
- Record implementation findings **as they are found**, in the spec's own
  findings section, including the ones that refute the spec. A finding discovered
  and then quietly designed around is the same as one never found.

## Step 4 — Adversarial review of the diff

A single reviewer is admissible for a phase diff **and the record must say
"one reviewer is one reviewer"**; the project's plan-review bar
(`references/project.md`; default: one independent reviewer in a different
tool) remains the bar for plan review and milestone close. Invocation, prompt
shape, the reproduce-before-believe rule, the retained-evidence sanitization
trap, and what a review that finds nothing still owes are in
[`references/review-and-record.md`](references/review-and-record.md).

Every finding is reproduced before it is believed, every fix carries a
regression test **proven to fail against the pre-fix code**, and the reviewer's
findings are retained verbatim.

Every finding is then **triaged for MVP relevance before any of it is fixed** —
blocking, hardening, or completeness, with completeness deferred by default. The
classes, the default handling, and why a reviewer's severity rating cannot do
this job are in
[`references/review-convergence.md`](references/review-convergence.md).

## Step 5 — Refactoring review

After the code and its adversarial review land, ask one question explicitly:
**what did this phase's work reveal about existing structure that should
change?**

The record carries a `Refactoring review` section with one of exactly two honest
answers:

- **Refactors EXECUTED** — each named, behavior-preserving, landed behind the
  same green gates as the phase's own work.
- **"None needed"**, argued from what the phase actually touched. An asserted
  negative fails record review the same way an unfalsifiable gate does.

A refactor **seen but deferred** is an open-questions row with a named target
milestone. Never silent debt.

## Step 6 — Record + commit

The record is the phase's completion. Contract, scope tokens, the phase-specific
extensions to the base record format, and the commit grammar are in
[`references/review-and-record.md`](references/review-and-record.md). In short:
gate commands and exits **verbatim**, evidence bound by path + sha256, a
mandatory boundary section, open questions, refuted premises when a belief died,
and the refactoring-review section from step 5.

In a project with a component index, run its check against the phase's base
before writing the record, and list it among the record's gates with its
command and exit verbatim:

```bash
python scripts/components_index.py changed --base <the phase's base commit> --strict
```

Fix every `fail:`. For a `warn:` (a new caller of a retired component), call the
replacement or record the reason in the boundary section and rerun without
`--strict`, saying so. For each `reread:` line, read the entry beside the diff
and either edit it or state in the record that it is still accurate. Duplicates
and tangles the phase exposed in code it did not touch go to the step 5 answer
as deferred refactors, not into this phase.

The commit uses the record contract's grammar with a phase scope token, an
evidence-bearing body, `--` rather than em-dashes, **no backticks anywhere in
the message**, and the record path on its own closing line. Stage by explicit
path — never `git add -A`.

This step has no STOP while the commit stays inside what the gate at step 2
approved. The go-ahead rule, and the case in which the commit does stop for the
owner, are in
[`references/milestone-record-format.md`](references/milestone-record-format.md)
(When a record is due).

## Phase shapes this protocol has to cover

The six steps do not change. What changes is where the difficulty sits, and a
spec that misreads its own shape discharges the wrong obligations.

| Shape | Example work | Where the difficulty sits |
|---|---|---|
| **Schema / loader** | a format version, a new reader | backward compatibility pinned by identity tests; old readers frozen, and any admitted exception named |
| **Evaluator** | new checking semantics | the branch table and its coverage; the fixtures' reachability; a normative order with exactly one home |
| **Enablement** | a new input kind, a subprocess runner, a hardened parser | trust boundaries -- every refusal exercised, and an accepted **residual** restated in the reviewers' own terms rather than softened |
| **Harness / orchestration** | a step harness, a skill rewritten as a thin wrapper | the order pinned as a **literal**; fake-step tests for the branches; and at least ONE real end-to-end run, since a walk of fakes proves the harness, not the walk |
| **Read-only view** | a coverage or report surface | criteria that are **absences** -- no aggregate number, no file written, no command consuming the output. An absence is pinned field-for-field, because an absence test that cannot fail is the protocol's defining defect wearing its most convincing disguise |
| **Dogfood** | a migration run over this repository | the gate output **is** the artifact. Criteria must be predicates a run can fail -- "the tool shows an honest wall of open work" is not one; "the committed output is cited by digest and its uncovered count is strictly greater than zero" is |

Two structural notes:

- **Multi-part phases** (a tool plus its dogfood run, say) get one spec covering
  both parts and one record per part, numbered monotonically. A part that lands
  separately gets its own gate output; neither part's record claims the other's.
- **A criterion may not depend on a phase the plan calls optional.** If this
  phase's criteria need an earlier phase's output, that dependency is **hard**,
  and if the plan's header says otherwise the plan is wrong -- record it as a
  refuted premise with an open-questions row, and say so before implementing
  against a dependency that might not be there.

## The rules that bind every phase

The plan's section 0 design rules, the project's standing design rules
(`references/project.md`), and the failure classes a phase can re-commit bind
every phase; their format and the protocol's own failure classes are in
[`references/standing-rules.md`](references/standing-rules.md). A spec discharges
each **by name** or argues it inapplicable; silence on one is a review finding.

## Limits — what this skill does not establish

- **A completed walk of these six steps is not an acceptance claim.** Each step
  has its own gate and each gate speaks for itself; running them in order adds
  no authority to any of them.
- **The adversarial review is one reviewer's reading**, usually without the
  ability to run the full suite. It is evidence, not a proof of correctness.
- **An independence pass, where one runs, is a disagreement locator.** An
  agreeing reader and an agreeing implementation can be wrong together, and
  nothing in this protocol separates that case.
- **Repeated review rounds are not monotone improvement.** Same-reviewer
  finding counts need not fall from round to round, because each repair round
  can open the next round's findings and an adversarial reviewer rarely comes
  back empty. Only the convergence measures in
  [`references/review-convergence.md`](references/review-convergence.md)
  distinguish progress from churn; a finding count alone never does.
- **This skill never edits the milestone plan**, records owner decisions or explicitly delegated auto rulings, and never
  proceeds past a STOP on inference.
