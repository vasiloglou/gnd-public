# model-composition

Planning opened 2026-11-09 for GR-D4, [issue 95](https://github.com/vasiloglou/gnd-public/issues/95):
one model file takes its object types, fact types and constraints from
another, pinned by sha256, and adds the project's own rules.

**Status: plan r3 approved by the owner on 2026-11-09, MD1-MD16 as proposed
([plan-gate record](001-plan.md)).** Two Codex rounds ran (r1 revise, 18
findings; r2 revise, 13), every finding reproduced and applied; r3 was not
reviewed, because the convergence stop rule fired (plan §11). No phase has
started; no code is written.

- [Plan (r3, approved)](notes/model-composition-plan.md)
- [Plan-gate record](001-plan.md)
- [MC1 spec (r3, draft, awaiting its owner gate)](notes/phase-MC1-spec.md)
- [Codex review of r1](evidence/plan-review-r1/codex-review.md), with the
  reviewed r1 bytes and the prompt beside it
- [Codex review of r2](evidence/plan-review-r2/codex-review.md), likewise

Phases: MC1 (contract, loader, route guards, validate and check), MC2
(consumer support), MC3 (evolve, re-pin, proposal writers, end-to-end
scenario), MC4 (docs and skills); close.

Pending decisions: MC1's D1-D8 (spec §7).

Next action: the MC1 spec gate (the owner rules D1-D8 and approves the spec), then MC1 implementation under process-phase.
